# Cat-Wiki - Simple-Wikipedia-Clone

A full stack wikipedia CRUD application built from the ground up and still going.

## Features

- "Secure" user account system with password hashing
- Page creation functionality with database integration (editing coming soon)
- "Decent" UI (not written by me)
- Article support with Markdown formatting and input sanitization
- and more..?

## Purpose

This project started as a way for me to learn full-stack development, and has been a great introduction to building a complete application from the ground up. It’s also a bit of a passion project—my first real attempt at putting something out there. It’s definitely not perfect, and there’s plenty of room for improvement -- sheesh alot of the code is dodgy, but I’m proud to share this version as a finished (for now) release.

If the motivation sticks around, I'd like to keep adding features over time :)
